# Bohr's Atomic Model

- Atoms -> **Building Blocks of Matter**

## Rutherford's Planetary Model

![rutherfords model](https://github.com/AAOOII-RN/Notes/blob/main/Q2/Science/rutherfords.png)
- Atoms have orbiting **electron revolving a massive nucleus** like the solar system
- Problem: James Maxwell stated -> Charged particles, when orbiting an electromagnetic field will accumulate energy and eventually lose all of it.

## Bohr's Model

![bohr's model](https://github.com/AAOOII-RN/Notes/blob/main/Q2/Science/bohrs.png)
- **Niels Bohr (1885-1962) -> Danish Physicist**
- **Quanta** -> **A packet of energy**, used to represent smth (Photon -> Quanta of light, Electrons -> Quanta of electricity)
- **Planck's Theory** -> Energy is **stored in forms of quanta**
- Electrons **shift** to another orbital v**ia losing or gaining quanta**
- Problem: The model was too simple and didn't explain for how an electron orbits

## Bohr-Sommerfeld's Atomic Model

![sommersfelds model](https://github.com/AAOOII-RN/Notes/blob/main/Q2/Science/sommerfeld.png)
- Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld
- Refined Bohr's model by introducing **elliptical orbits** which helps explain the paths of an electron

## Schrodinger-Broglie's Study

![alt text](https://github.com/AAOOII-RN/Notes/blob/main/Q2/Science/schrodinger.png)
- Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrodinger + Louis De Broglie
- Quantum Mechanical Model -> Electrons exists as **electron clouds**
- Quanta are calculated via equations unlike Bohr's, in which they are assumed

## Werner Heisenberg's Study

- Werner Heisenberg (1901-1976) -> German Physicist
- Uncertainty Principle -> "It is **impossible to determine** both the momentum and the position of an electron **at the same time accurately**"
- Electron Clouds -> Probable positions of an electron instead of an elliptical orbits. Since electrons move rapidly like a wave, it looks like a cloud **like a spinning fan**.
