# Inheritance

## Terms
1. Heredity -> Passing of genes
2. Variation -> Differences between individuals
3. Genetics study of heredity and variation

## Chromosome
* Tightly packed in the nucleus
* Histones is called when they're winded up
* DNA coiled up around it
* Carrier of genes
* Prokaryote -> Exists in the cytoplasm of the nucleoid
* Eukaryote -> Exists in the nucleus

Homologous -> same origin and function

## Homologous Chromosome
* Gametes -> Sex cells, haploid
* Somantic Cells -> body cells, diploid
* Diploid Number -> 46, represents # of somatic cells
* Haploid Number -> 23, # of gametes
* Homologous pairs must have paternal and maternal pair

# Human Chromosomes
* 46 Chromosomes (Diploid)
* 23 Chromosomes (Haploid)
* 7 Groups (A-G)
* Genosomes -> sex chromosome (Female=XX, Male=XY)

# Cell division
1. Mitosis -> division of body cells
2. Meiosis -> division of sex cells
3. Cancer -> uncontrolled cell growth
* Interphase
    * Growth
    * Dna replication
    * cell functions
    * Duplicates genetic material
4. Nucleus -> organelle, contains DNA
5. DNA -> holds genetic info

# Genetic Inheritance
* Gregor Johanne Mendel -> Father of Genetics, Garden Pea
* Alleles -> pairs of genes
* Dominant -> expressed whether one or two are present
* Codominant -> Both are dominant, both are expressed
* Incomplete Dominance -> Introduces a third phenotype
* Recessive -> expressed only if there's two are present
* Geneotype -> Genetic Makeup
* Phenotype -> Physical
